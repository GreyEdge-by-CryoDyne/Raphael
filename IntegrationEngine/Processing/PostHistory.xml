I'm not a moderator or anything (yet...), but I just wanted to welcome everyone with &lt;del&gt;the first&lt;/del&gt; one of the first Meta posts, and also point out a few housekeeping lessons I've learned from being a long-time engaged user of a number of Stack Exchange sites. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is my first private beta, but from the types of questions I've seen already, this has the potential to be a really cool site. Obviously, with a dearth of previous questions, askers have limited existing tags from which to choose, and will likely end up making new ones to fit their particular situation. However, even in the first hour, we're already getting partial duplicates ([tag:finish] and [tag:finishing]), misspellings ([tag:chisel] and [tag:chissel]), and possible redundancies ([tag:wood-turning] should possibly be just [tag:turning]?). We should have a discussion about tag formatting, singular vs. plural forms, and all that, perhaps toward the end of the private beta so we can be ready for public access.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the most important activities you can do on any SE site (along with asking high-quality questions and giving high-quality answers) is editing. Remember that all contributions here are licensed [CC-BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), and we are all free to clean things up. Yes, there have been long debates on [Meta.SE](http://meta.stackexchange.com) and some of the site-specific metas like [Meta.SO](http://meta.stackoverflow.com) on how far edits should go, how much community members can do that might change the original author's intent, etc. However, it is perfectly acceptable, and even encouraged, to fix spelling and grammar errors, add/remove tags, improve formatting, and generally clean up questions and answers. If in doubt, ask the OP (&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;riginal &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;oster) or [bring it up](http://meta.woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/ask) here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, internal discussion is key to keeping a site alive and relevant. Our [definition](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/61927?phase=definition) on Area51 was certainly a good start, but we want to keep asking ourselves what the true aim of the site is, its target audience, and whether we need to broaden/narrow its scope after a while. Keep up the Meta discussions, use chat (once it's set up, not sure if it's ready yet), keep commenting on questions and answers, offer constructive critiques, and help your fellow woodworkers out!"

One of the features of a semi-curated site like this - where we're doing the curation via voting - is that it hopefully gives a more useful single answer (and explanation) than reading a bunch of google results; and it helps people who don't have the knowledge to understand which google result is right, or even to structure the search properly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It also helps build up a user base to have questions at many different skill levels.

Everyone should keep in mind that the SE is a world wide community. While we will be getting a lot of varied people asking/answering questions, *how* they ask/answer questions will be just as varied. This site is based on the English language. While we here in America would like to think we have mastered the language, there are others who would not see that quite the same way. If someone in a Q/A uses a different spelling of a word than we are used to, it doesn't mean it automatically needs to be edited. For instance, in the UK &amp; Europe, they might use the word &quot;tyre&quot; instead of &quot;tire&quot;, or place the &quot;er&quot; as an &quot;re&quot; at the end of a word (ie: litre v. liter). This to me is local color and depends on where you are from. Are either of these things wrong? **Absolutely not**. Please take this into account when seeing such things and looking for the edit button. We don't need to change how a person says something if it is completely understandable the way it is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a similar note, I've seen where people who are not native to the English language write a Q/A and it gets all kinds of down-votes. It is my belief these down-votes come because the author's command of the English language is not that great. The problem is *the question itself was sound and on-topic*. Please be gentle in these situations and help the OP to create a better Q/A and not just shoot them down mid-stride. This is a great way to drive people away from the site instead of drawing them in like we all would like to see.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Above all, remember the SE way of things: *Be Nice*. It seems we have a very good start in that direction. I hope we will continue down that road and this SE will flourish like so many others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly I'll just say, welcome to the site: Now go out and throw some wood together! :D" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It is the experts job to moderate these into good questions rather then close them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You will note that once the site gets out of private Beta, into public Beta,  users need more score to edit questions without peer review of those edits. I think it is 3000 points for a site and 1500 points for a site in beta to submit edits without peer review. This insures that the edits are made by experts or reviewed by the experts for a site. Which keeps the edits on topic and fair. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All edits can be undone. You may often find that an edit is bad, and choose to undo the edit or take a shot at the edit yourself. It is all about making a question or answer useful.

We all own whatever anybody posts here in the sense that we want it to be a quality piece of work and we should treat it that way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We also should help the new people that will be coming along, to edit a question so that they learn the SE ways of doing things.

This is what meta is for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I need guidance as to how to fix this so as to not lead other users astray. One suggestion is to break out the different cut appearances into another question. The controversy, I think, would still exist in that new question.  " ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

When&#xD;&#xA;&gt; rift-sawn, each piece is cut along a radius of the original log, so&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that the saw cuts at right angles to the tree's growth rings. Quarter&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sawn is defined as boards made by sawing a log into quarters and then&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sawing out boards in parallel cuts with varying angles of the sides&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to the growth rings up to 30°, 45° or 60° from the annual&#xD;&#xA;&gt; rings. **However, quarter-sawn and rift-sawn are used with opposite&#xD;&#xA;&gt; meanings and as synonyms so there is confusion about their&#xD;&#xA;&gt; meanings.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in summary, you are technically correct in your interpretation, but apparently &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; has rewritten modern books and references with a different interpretation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift_sawing" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It is far more cost effective and safer to have a DC that catches most of the chips and dust, and wear a respirator to prevent inhalation of the fine particles. In effect the DC is to help keep the shop clean. A good filter should be used to prevent the DC from blowing the small particles it does collect back into the shop. The larger HF DC with a Wynn 35A filter is an excellent choice for following this methodology." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Obviously it would not be feasible to harvest hardwood from a tree which does not belong to a hardwood species.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers posted thus far, including glw's self-answer, primarily focus on answering a completely different question, which is, &quot;How do I harvest wood from a tree?&quot; I suspect glw wanted to share a particular answer but did not properly frame the question with respect to that answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the question and answers, as they stand currently, are trying to address too many things all at once:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. the decision-making process for determining whether it makes sense to harvest wood from a tree&#xD;&#xA; 2. all conditions of trees, ranging from long-since-fallen to recently-felled, and from rotten to infested to fully-intact--and also including branches which broke off a tree while the rest of the tree is still standing&#xD;&#xA; 3. the process, from start to finish, for milling a tree into boards&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Not* differentiating these concerns could cause this to be treated as a general catch-all question; in turn causing many future, more specific, questions to be marked as duplicates when the answers to this question may not specifically address the nuances of the more specific questions. I've observed this problem many times on SU and have been disappointed when a very good, very specific question was summarily closed because it fell under the umbrella of a generic catch-all question. (For example, &quot;How do I do X on Linux?&quot; is often closed as a duplicate of, &quot;How do I do X?&quot; even if all the existing answers are only relevant to Windows.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the question should *at least* be split into the following questions, each of which should be written such that it can be answered definitively and objectively:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. How do I determine whether milling a tree into lumber will be worth the time, cost, and effort?&#xD;&#xA; 2. What is the process, from start to finish, for milling a tree into boards?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feasible&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/feasible" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

My wife uses one as a clothes-folding station by the dryer, I have several setup as a quasi-continuous counter surface around the perimeter of my basement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How did I do it?  I followed the plans pretty much as outlined.  When I built these, I did not have a miter saw, so I used a circular saw to cut through the 2x4's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Lessons learned:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Clamps are your friend.  If you're using a Kreg jig, you might want to invest in a Kreg Right-Angle clamp, which makes it much easier to secure the work pieces for screwing.  Even with the right-angle clamp, however, I did have some bending issues.  Now that I have big pipe clamps in my arsenal, if I were to make this workbench again, I would probably use the right angle clamp AND pipe clamps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Don't measure each piece when making multiples of the same size.  Measure the first piece and then cut.  Use that cut piece to mark the same distance for each subsequent cut.  This is called using a &quot;Story Pole.&quot;  It is more accurate than measuring every time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Things I added:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - At one point, I had wheels on this table so I could move it around.

My wife uses one as a clothes-folding station by the dryer, I have several setup as a quasi-continuous counter surface around the perimeter of my basement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How did I do it?  I followed the plans pretty much as outlined.  When I built these, I did not have a miter saw, so I used a circular saw to cut through the 2x4's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Tools used:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Jigsaw, for cutting MDF slots for legs&#xD;&#xA; - Circular saw, for cutting mdf benchtop to proper dimensions&#xD;&#xA; - Drill, for drilling pocket holes and engaging screws,&#xD;&#xA; - Kreg right-angle clamp, for holding stile to rail while attaching the pocket hole screws&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Lessons learned:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Clamps are your friend.  If you're using a Kreg jig, you might want to invest in a Kreg Right-Angle clamp, which makes it much easier to secure the work pieces for screwing.  Even with the right-angle clamp, however, I did have some bending issues.  Now that I have big pipe clamps in my arsenal, if I were to make this workbench again, I would probably use the right angle clamp AND pipe clamps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Don't measure each piece when making multiples of the same size.  Measure the first piece and then cut.  Use that cut piece to mark the same distance for each subsequent cut.  This is called using a &quot;Story Pole.&quot;  It is more accurate than measuring every time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Things I added:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - At one point, I had wheels on this table so I could move it around.

The general question of every community project is &quot;How **did you** do/build/create/make.. this?&quot;. Notice that the question is not asking for thoughts on how this _could_ be done. The only way to answer is to do as you're told and build the object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How can I find a community project?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of them have the tag `community-project`. Looking for questions with that tag will list all projects: http://meta.woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/community-project&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, users that start a community project should add it to this list:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Let's Build a Workbench!][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How can I participate in a community project?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Answer the question. In order to do that, you have to build the object (or whatever the project says). If you have questions on how to do things, ask them on the main site: http://woodworking.stackexchange.com. Asking questions is encouraged behaviour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You finished the project? Congratulations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Share your result in an answer to the question that started the project. If you can, please add some pictures to display your work and explain your experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are sharing your project with the rest of the world, outside of woodworking.SE, please consider adding a link back to the original question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Is there a deadline for a project?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. A community project runs forever, to give new members the chance to participate. Users will vote their favourite answers up, but there can never be an accepted answer because of the way the question is asked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Can there be only one community project at a time?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Absolutely not!  Please feel free to add community projects if you'd like to encourage your fellow woodworking.se members to try the project out for themselves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/204/community-project-lets-build-a-workbench" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

You find them in technical drawings in mechanical engineering.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You are probably not familiar with them because outside of engineering, people are not used to the units and numbers used. They are often hard to imagine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's why they are expressed by making comparisons to more commonly known objects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[this sphere for example][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  These spheres are among the roundest man-made objects in the world. If the best of these spheres were scaled to the size of Earth, its high point—a continent-size area—would rise to a maximum elevation of 2.4 meters above &quot;sea level&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That gives you an idea of how much it differs from being a perfect square.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Compare it to this wording of the tolerance in technical terms:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  The sphere shown in the photograph has an out-of-roundness value (peak to valley on the radius) of 50 nm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You are probably more familiar with the imperial system, so an &quot;m&quot; (meter) is unfamiliar ground. nm means 0,000000001m that's 1 nanometer, that is&#xD;&#xA;3.93700787 × 10^8 inches&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, it only makes sense to specify the tolerances if they are very tight and the manufactured object is something very precise. Nothing you really come across in woodworking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the term still holds its meaning regardless of the numbers. You can specify tolerances as tight as you want. In woodworking, you might specify an out-of-roundness value of 5mm (~ 1/5 of an inch).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Suggestion for the tag**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Create the tags `tolerance` and `dimensioning` as synonymous. Time will tell which phrase people will use more often.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not sure how well the tag search works (you enter a part of the tag an it shows you you all that contain that part), but maybe the tag should be `geometric-dimensioning-and-tolerancing` with `GD&amp;T` as synonym.

Look at all the tools in your shop, and for each one ask yourself the following questions:&#xD;&#xA;  1. What problems have I had with this tool?&#xD;&#xA;  2. What do I know now that I wish I would have known before?&#xD;&#xA;  3. Why did I buy this tool?&#xD;&#xA;  4. Do I still use this tool? Why or why not?&#xD;&#xA;  5.

Why do I think I want that tool?&#xD;&#xA;  2. Why haven't I bought that type of tool yet?&#xD;&#xA;  2. What would I want to know before I would ever buy it?&#xD;&#xA; 7. Consider areas of woodworking that you do not currently practice, and assume for a moment that you want to add one or more of those to your repertoire. What questions do you have?&#xD;&#xA; 8.

The general question of every community project is &quot;How **did you** do/build/create/make.. this?&quot;. Notice that the question is not asking for thoughts on how this _could_ be done. The only way to answer is to do as you're told and build the object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How can I find a community project?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of them have the tag `community-project`. Looking for questions with that tag will list all projects: http://meta.woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/community-project&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, users that start a community project should add it to this list:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Let's Build a Workbench!][1]&#xD;&#xA; - [Let's make a birdhouse!][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How can I participate in a community project?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Answer the question. In order to do that, you have to build the object (or whatever the project says). If you have questions on how to do things, ask them on the main site: http://woodworking.stackexchange.com. Asking questions is encouraged behaviour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What should I include in my answer?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well done! You finished the project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Share your result in an answer to the question that started the project. The minimum content of your answer should be at least 1 picture to display your work. Feel free to explain your technique, findings and problems that you had throughout the project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are sharing your project with the rest of the world, outside of woodworking.SE, please consider adding a link back to the original question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Is there a deadline for a project?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. A community project runs forever, to give new members the chance to participate. Users will vote their favourite answers up, but there can never be an accepted answer because of the way the question is asked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Can there be only one community project at a time?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Absolutely not!

When posting a question, consider whether it's possible to split that single question into multiple questions.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Go to any other woodworking sites you've participated on, and copy some of *your* past questions to this site.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Try to think of something you've done wrong in the past, and post a question about it.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Get out to your shop and build something. Every time you do something, ask yourself, &quot;Why did I do it that way?&quot; and consider whether that would make a good question.&#xD;&#xA; 5. Look at all the tools in your shop, and for each one ask yourself the following questions:&#xD;&#xA;  1. What problems have I had with this tool?&#xD;&#xA;  2. What do I know now that I wish I would have known before?&#xD;&#xA;  3. Why did I buy this tool?&#xD;&#xA;  4. Do I still use this tool? Why or why not?&#xD;&#xA;  5. Am I using this tool in the most efficient way possible?&#xD;&#xA; 6. Consider tools that you *don't* own but have considered buying, and ask yourself the following questions:&#xD;&#xA;  1. Why do I think I want that tool?&#xD;&#xA;  2. Why haven't I bought that type of tool yet?&#xD;&#xA;  2. What would I want to know before I would ever buy it?&#xD;&#xA; 7. Consider areas of woodworking that you do not currently practice, and assume for a moment that you want to add one or more of those to your repertoire. What questions do you have?&#xD;&#xA; 8. Watch popular woodworking youtube channels. Find something interesting they did to solve a problem and ask for solutions to that problem.&#xD;&#xA; 9. Organize community challenges; for example:&#xD;&#xA;  * [Community Projects][1]&#xD;&#xA;  * Topic challenges similar to those run by [Movies.SE][2]&#xD;&#xA; 10.

Plenty will read everything but there is a reason, in new at least, there articles are structured the way they are. &#xD;&#xA;- Weak answers that might answer the question but could just be cases of rep farming.

We would, in the fullness of time, have to cover queries on:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* automotive paint&#xD;&#xA;* faux painting — fake marble/granite etc., metals — in both water and oil media, and in mixed media&#xD;&#xA;* decorative painting, in both water and oil media&#xD;&#xA;* gilding&#xD;&#xA;* decorative lacquer&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think there's just no way we should try to tackle all of those in addition to all of the established finish options and their possible combinations.

Then i discovered the [tag synonyms][2] page which @rob and @bowlturner already used. IMO the glue/gluing thing is not exactly a candidate for a synonym, but as gluing isn't really used except in one question, one could argue that the majority here uses glue anyway and we should drop gluing to keep the tags clear and easier to use. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of this my have already been answered in [Tag Guidelines Meta question][3].

There is, in a general sense, no one answer to these kinds of questions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Synonyms&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not the only reason but easy justification for synonyms should be used for tags that are similar but have very different names but for the same thing. Simple example would be [tag:band-aid] and [tag:adhesive-bandage]. Most people asking about BandAids are actually asking about the generic product [tag:adhesive-bandage].

These questions are not appropriate and do not play to the strengths of Stack Exchange sites.&#xD;&#xA;2. Simply closing them or putting them on hold is not particularly welcoming for the poster, many of whom will be new to the site.  We need another alternative.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My suggestions are to either convert the question to a list of places where woodworkers can have this discussion or to curate such a list and provide it directly in the comment when putting the question on hold.  A list is no longer subjective.  Either the individual elements on the list support that sort of discussion or they don't.  Thus, I believe it is a fair question to ask on SE sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even if the community ultimately decides even asking for lists of other places where subjective discussions take place is not acceptable, what's the harm in curating one possible list and providing it as a part of closing the question?  The benefit is clear: “We don't answer subjective questions, but these places do” is far more welcoming than “We don't answer subjective questions.”  If Stack Exchange is neither interested nor well-positioned for this type of discussion, then a curated list of places where these discussions take place could be used in virtually every response to a subjective question of this nature.

I'm not a moderator or anything (yet...), but I just wanted to welcome everyone with &lt;del&gt;the first&lt;/del&gt; one of the first Meta posts, and also point out a few housekeeping lessons I've learned from being a long-time engaged user of a number of Stack Exchange sites. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is my first private beta, but from the types of questions I've seen already, this has the potential to be a really cool site. Obviously, with a dearth of previous questions, askers have limited existing tags from which to choose, and will likely end up making new ones to fit their particular situation. However, even in the first hour, we're already getting partial duplicates ([tag:finish] and [tag:finishing]), misspellings ([tag:chisel] and [tag:chissel]), and possible redundancies ([tag:wood-turning] should possibly be just [tag:turning]?). We should have a discussion about tag formatting, singular vs. plural forms, and all that, perhaps toward the end of the private beta so we can be ready for public access.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the most important activities you can do on any SE site (along with asking high-quality questions and giving high-quality answers) is editing. Remember that all contributions here are licensed [CC-BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), and we are all free to clean things up. Yes, there have been long debates on [Meta.SE](http://meta.stackexchange.com) and some of the site-specific metas like [Meta.SO](http://meta.stackoverflow.com) on how far edits should go, how much community members can do that might change the original author's intent, etc. However, it is perfectly acceptable, and even encouraged, to fix spelling and grammar errors, add/remove tags, improve formatting, and generally clean up questions and answers. If in doubt, ask the OP (&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;riginal &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;oster) or [bring it up](https://woodworking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/ask) here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, internal discussion is key to keeping a site alive and relevant. Our [definition](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/61927?phase=definition) on Area51 was certainly a good start, but we want to keep asking ourselves what the true aim of the site is, its target audience, and whether we need to broaden/narrow its scope after a while. Keep up the Meta discussions, use chat (once it's set up, not sure if it's ready yet), keep commenting on questions and answers, offer constructive critiques, and help your fellow woodworkers out!"

The general question of every community project is &quot;How **did you** do/build/create/make.. this?&quot;. Notice that the question is not asking for thoughts on how this _could_ be done. The only way to answer is to do as you're told and build the object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How can I find a community project?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of them have the tag `community-project`. Looking for questions with that tag will list all projects: https://woodworking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/community-project&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, users that start a community project should add it to this list:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Let's Build a Workbench!][1]&#xD;&#xA; - [Let's make a birdhouse!][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How can I participate in a community project?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Answer the question. In order to do that, you have to build the object (or whatever the project says). If you have questions on how to do things, ask them on the main site: http://woodworking.stackexchange.com. Asking questions is encouraged behaviour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What should I include in my answer?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well done! You finished the project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Share your result in an answer to the question that started the project. The minimum content of your answer should be at least 1 picture to display your work. Feel free to explain your technique, findings and problems that you had throughout the project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are sharing your project with the rest of the world, outside of woodworking.SE, please consider adding a link back to the original question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Is there a deadline for a project?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. A community project runs forever, to give new members the chance to participate. Users will vote their favourite answers up, but there can never be an accepted answer because of the way the question is asked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Can there be only one community project at a time?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Absolutely not!  Please feel free to add community projects if you'd like to encourage your fellow woodworking.se members to try the project out for themselves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://woodworking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/204/community-project-lets-build-a-workbench&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://woodworking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/218/community-project-lets-make-a-birdhouse" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

While admittedly they could/should be different tags, the glue tag has been used for gluing relevant questions while the gluing tag hasn't been used much at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Same goes for [tag:tags] and [tag:tagging] and probably a few more.

Then i discovered the [tag synonyms][2] page which @rob and @bowlturner already used. IMO the glue/gluing thing is not exactly a candidate for a synonym, but as gluing isn't really used except in one question, one could argue that the majority here uses glue anyway and we should drop gluing to keep the tags clear and easier to use. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of this my have already been answered in [Tag Guidelines Meta question][3].

(As long as the as the earlier points for good additional answers are met this should be a non issue). This speaks to the behavior of the user on the site. Not everyone works this way.  Plenty will read everything but there is a reason, in new at least, there articles are structured the way they are. &#xD;&#xA;- Weak answers that might answer the question but could just be cases of rep farming.

I specifically was avoiding the title `What is this tool?` because I knew _that_ was going to be too localized. I tried to keep it a good question with my current title `Is this a specific kind of hand drill?` but I could see this still being an issue. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even the other question. Now that you mention it, that question, as it stands currently, is not a good one for the primary reason we discourage wood identification questions. __It's just a picture__.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__What we can't allow outright__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any question that is, simply put, `What is this?` or a simple paraphrase thereof with only a picture. But in _some cases_ we could encourage the users to improve it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__Before you call me a hypocrite__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I did try to add more detail to my own question to get away from that. I suppose I could have put more of a description about the tool's usage.... `A push motion makes the shaft turn`?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Someone googling push and drill or even just hand drill (which was my thinking), with help from SE SEO, might make their way here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Ongoing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We can vote to close questions like this (even mine if you choose) and mention to the OP that `while this question could be considered to localized, adding as much detail as possibly can add to the question's long-term value`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the joinery question just used the words `corner` and `grooves` that would have been sufficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__Compare to wood identification questions__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, &quot;What kind of wood is this?&quot; accompanied by a picture. A picture is not enough since you need more details like I talk about in [this answer](https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/599/128)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Things like joint identification, and I thought in my case of tool identification, don't rely on those factors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# At the end of the day&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These types of questions should be left open if the right details are present. You could easily link these to tool usage questions as well. `How do I use a push drill` and `How can I make a finger joint corner brace for a chair?` which bolsters the site. The solution to the latter _seems_ obvious to me but maybe not to others. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once the solution is clear updating the question is a good idea. It just irks me when you see `Code does not work [solved]` in titles. I would think a title such as mine to be good. &#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It means exactly what its definition says, it's used exactly as its definition implies, and you use it in any context where it is appropriate to use that word. If something has a camber then that something has a camber. That's it. This site is not the right site for asking things like &quot;Can you give me an example of something with a curve in it?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nothing more can really be said about it and at this point I think it is a language issue. Example usages can be found in the dictionary link. The word itself is not specific to woodworking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are asking about camber in something specific, and that something has to do with woodworking, you can always post a new, clear question here. The other reason nothing more could be said about &quot;camber&quot; is that you were specifically asked to provide more context there and you did not, so you will also have to work on ways to formulate questions more clearly, remembering that **nobody here is looking over your shoulder reading what you are reading and seeing what you are seeing, and we have no way of knowing what you are looking at unless you tell us.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;I'm reading about extendable tables, what is 'camber'?&quot; is not enough for anything more than a link to a dictionary definition of &quot;camber&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are asking something specifically about table slides then you need to be clear about exactly what you are asking. A camber in a table slide is exactly what it says: A camber (a curve) in a table slide. So it's a table slide with a camber. A table slide with a curve in it. Get it? If you want to know something more about the shape of a particular table slide then be clear. We couldn't tell what you were asking there because you were unclear: For all we knew you were talking about a camber in the table, in its legs, in one piece of wood, in your tools, we had to take wild guesses at what curved thing you had in mind, with our only hint being that this mysterious cambered object you were asking about was somehow related to tables."

While admittedly they could/should be different tags, the glue tag has been used for gluing relevant questions while the gluing tag hasn't been used much at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Same goes for [tag:tags] and [tag:tagging] and probably a few more.

Then i discovered the [tag synonyms][2] page which @rob and @bowlturner already used.

In summary,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Think about this: it takes 5 people to vote to migrate a question. At which point, the destination site gets to decide whether or not the question is appropriate, potentially rejecting it. [...]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **The question *still* wasn't written by someone familiar with the site where it ends up posted.** They had no opportunity read the Help Center or About pages, or even to see existing questions on the site! The question probably isn't well-tagged (indeed, the system will automatically reject questions that have no valid tags on the destination), and very possibly missing details that are important to the folks who would be most likely to answer it...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ***[U]sers* don't get migrated.** They get notified of the migration, but they still have to go set up an account on the destination site before they'll be notified of any comments or answers left on their question post-migration. So requests for clarification often go unheard. This is never fun for anyone, but it's particularly harsh on a small and growing community still trying to establish their scope and standards for quality - for this reason, we **do not** create default migration paths to beta sites, and strongly discourage even moderators from migrating to/from sites in their formative stages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [...]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [I]n most cases, it's more effective - and *certainly* more expedient - to skip migration entirely and just **vote to close as off-topic while leaving a comment** directing the asker to a more appropriate site (or sites...). This gives the asker a chance to *create an account* and familiarize himself with the community and their scope before throwing his question up, and also tends to weed out some of the folks less willing to put any real effort into addressing criticism."

The only major difference between a Beta site and a graduated site I have found is that moderators are selected by StackExchange instead of community elections.  I was recently selected as a moderator, I suspect partially because I volunteered myself, to give something back to the site I had enjoyed and learned from for years, when StackExchange asked for nominations (I was also the sole candidate at that time).  Moderator duties are very light and the community members mostly manage things without the need for interventions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not aware of any other significant differences other that the word &quot;Beta&quot; in the site title.

Hand tools require much less space for a workshop (a corner of a bedroom and a workmate can be enough), are usually far quieter to use, and are more accessible to those on a small budget. (Again, Paul Sellers' later videos address this group)&#xD;&#xA;* The &quot;rural&quot; woodworker. Someone with a garage or shed large enough to have a dedicated workspace in which they can set up tools like jointers, planers, stationary table saws, and so on. They might not make a living from woodworking: instead it might be part of (say) running their farm or maintaining their house, or a hobby. There are quite a few of these on the 'tube, and they often include a lot of tool reviews/unboxings etc.&#xD;&#xA;* The primarily power-tool based - I think Steve Ramsey is the best example. Large workshop, rarely picks up a hand tool, very focused on the end product and less so on the experience and sensations of working the wood.&#xD;&#xA;* The mixed user. Here, think Rob Cosman and &quot;Stumpy Nubs&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;* The homeowner doing an occasional DIY job which actually (and primarily) needs woodworking skills and knowledge. Think about building a full-height wooden shoe rack into a closet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm coming at it from the tools direction (there are other, probably better, criteria), because I think that is likely to drive the type of questions you see (and the type of people available for answering them). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Someone who is a house framer, for example, would have a very different approach to joining two pieces of wood at a right angle than a pure hand tools person. Heavy power tool users might drive a lot of discussion around dado blades, kickback, lathe techniques, and so on. A craftsman/hobbyist might want help choosing their minimal toolset (a #4, #4 1/2, or #5 plane for example): advice which is not sponsor-driven can be hard to find.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And this is before we consider artists who work in wood: sculpture/carving, marquetry, and so on.&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This is never fun for anyone, but it's particularly harsh on a small and growing community still trying to establish their scope and standards for quality - for this reason, we **do not** create default migration paths to beta sites, and strongly discourage even moderators from migrating to/from sites in their formative stages.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; [...]&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; [I]n most cases, it's more effective - and *certainly* more expedient - to skip migration entirely and just **vote to close as off-topic while leaving a comment** directing the asker to a more appropriate site (or sites...).

A picture is not enough since you need more details like I talk about in [this answer](https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/599/128)&#xA;&#xA;Things like joint identification, and I thought in my case of tool identification, don't rely on those factors.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;# At the end of the day&#xA;&#xA;These types of questions should be left open if the right details are present. You could easily link these to tool usage questions as well. `How do I use a push drill` and `How can I make a finger joint corner brace for a chair?` which bolsters the site. The solution to the latter _seems_ obvious to me but maybe not to others. &#xA;&#xA;Once the solution is clear updating the question is a good idea.
