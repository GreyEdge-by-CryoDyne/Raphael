Obviously, with a dearth of previous questions, askers have limited existing tags from which to choose, and will likely end up making new ones to fit their particular situation. However, even in the first hour, we're already getting partial duplicates (&lt;a href=&quot;https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/finish&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;finish&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;finish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/finishing&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;finishing&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;finishing&lt;/a&gt;), misspellings (&lt;a href=&quot;https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chisel&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;chisel&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;chisel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chissel&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;chissel&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;chissel&lt;/a&gt;), and possible redundancies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wood-turning&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;wood-turning&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;wood-turning&lt;/a&gt; should possibly be just &lt;a href=&quot;https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/turning&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;turning&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;turning&lt;/a&gt;?). We should have a discussion about tag formatting, singular vs. plural forms, and all that, perhaps toward the end of the private beta so we can be ready for public access.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important activities you can do on any SE site (along with asking high-quality questions and giving high-quality answers) is editing. Remember that all contributions here are licensed &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;CC-BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;, and we are all free to clean things up. Yes, there have been long debates on &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Meta.SE&lt;/a&gt; and some of the site-specific metas like &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;Meta.SO&lt;/a&gt; on how far edits should go, how much community members can do that might change the original author's intent, etc. However, it is perfectly acceptable, and even encouraged, to fix spelling and grammar errors, add/remove tags, improve formatting, and generally clean up questions and answers. If in doubt, ask the OP (&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;riginal &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;oster) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://woodworking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/ask&quot;&gt;bring it up&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, internal discussion is key to keeping a site alive and relevant. Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/61927?phase=definition&quot;&gt;definition&lt;/a&gt; on Area51 was certainly a good start, but we want to keep asking ourselves what the true aim of the site is, its target audience, and whether we need to broaden/narrow its scope after a while. Keep up the Meta discussions, use chat (once it's set up, not sure if it's ready yet), keep commenting on questions and answers, offer constructive critiques, and help your fellow woodworkers out!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T16:43:08.450" LastActivityDate="2015-03-18T10:49:24.520" Title="Keeping our shop clean" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Everyone should keep in mind that the SE is a world wide community. While we will be getting a lot of varied people asking/answering questions, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they ask/answer questions will be just as varied. This site is based on the English language. While we here in America would like to think we have mastered the language, there are others who would not see that quite the same way. If someone in a Q/A uses a different spelling of a word than we are used to, it doesn't mean it automatically needs to be edited. For instance, in the UK &amp;amp; Europe, they might use the word &quot;tyre&quot; instead of &quot;tire&quot;, or place the &quot;er&quot; as an &quot;re&quot; at the end of a word (ie: litre v. liter). This to me is local color and depends on where you are from. Are either of these things wrong? &lt;strong&gt;Absolutely not&lt;/strong&gt;. Please take this into account when seeing such things and looking for the edit button. We don't need to change how a person says something if it is completely understandable the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, I've seen where people who are not native to the English language write a Q/A and it gets all kinds of down-votes. It is my belief these down-votes come because the author's command of the English language is not that great. The problem is &lt;em&gt;the question itself was sound and on-topic&lt;/em&gt;. Please be gentle in these situations and help the OP to create a better Q/A and not just shoot them down mid-stride.

Rather, it was the moderator's duty to understand the reasoning behind the rules and to let the community largely govern itself, only intervening as necessary to maintain a well-oiled machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it's amazing how well the Stack Exchange platform works, and I've waited a long time for the same type of resource to come to the woodworking community. I want to do what I can to make sure this site is as successful as Stack Overflow, Superuser, and the other Stack Exchange sites that I use on a daily basis.

It is far more cost effective and safer to have a DC that catches most of the chips and dust, and wear a respirator to prevent inhalation of the fine particles. In effect the DC is to help keep the shop clean. A good filter should be used to prevent the DC from blowing the small particles it does collect back into the shop.

The resulting wood can be prone to cracking.&quot; But for some reason, glw was compelled to go into great detail about the steps required to harvest usable wood from a tree or even its fallen limbs. It seems to me that much of the context included in the anecdotes of glw's answer should have been in the question instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we are to use the Oxford Dictionary definition of &lt;em&gt;feasible&lt;/em&gt;, then glw wasted an incredible amount of effort detailing the process when the first couple lines of the answer would have sufficed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting beyond the technical definition of &lt;em&gt;feasible&lt;/em&gt;, the title and body are inconsistent with one another, and there are several possible interpretations of each, some of which I've outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some possible interpretations based on the title. Note that a &lt;em&gt;fallen&lt;/em&gt; tree specifically refers to a tree that fell without being intentionally cut down--for example, it may have died and rotted, or the wind could have snapped its trunk or uprooted it. A &lt;em&gt;fallen&lt;/em&gt; tree could also be a tree that has been dead and perhaps decomposing for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;How does one determine whether a [naturally] fallen (not cut down, or &lt;em&gt;felled&lt;/em&gt;) tree is likely to yield usable hardwood lumber?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Is it easy to cut a [naturally] fallen tree into boards?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Under what conditions does it make sense to try to harvest hardwood lumber from a [naturally] fallen tree?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;If I find a tree that has been fallen for some indeterminate amount of time, how can I tell if it would be worth trying to mill it into lumber?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below are some interpretations based on the body, which refers to a tree that was intentionally cut down, or &lt;em&gt;felled&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps glw only intended to mention a &quot;tree removal specialist&quot; rather than an arborist, but the mention of an arborist implies that the tree was unhealthy. Some people may catch this detail and consider it in their answers, while others may not. The question should either omit the mention of the arborist (allowing answers to address both healthy and unhealthy trees), or it should more explicitly state that it applies only to unhealthy trees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;If I'm cutting down an unhealthy tree, is it easy to harvest lumber from the trunk for some future woodworking projects?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;If I'm cutting down an unhealthy tree, under what conditions does it make sense to use the trunk in woodworking projects?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;If I'm cutting down a tree [for any reason], is it easy to harvest wood from the trunk for some future woodworking projects?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;If I'm cutting down a tree [for any reason], under what conditions does it make sense to use the trunk in woodworking projects?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the question does not want to specify whether the tree has naturally fallen or whether it was felled, it should clarify that point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the question is overly-specific in one respect. Obviously it would not be feasible to harvest hardwood from a tree which does not belong to a hardwood species.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers posted thus far, including glw's self-answer, primarily focus on answering a completely different question, which is, &quot;How do I harvest wood from a tree?&quot; I suspect glw wanted to share a particular answer but did not properly frame the question with respect to that answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the question and answers, as they stand currently, are trying to address too many things all at once:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the decision-making process for determining whether it makes sense to harvest wood from a tree&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;all conditions of trees, ranging from long-since-fallen to recently-felled, and from rotten to infested to fully-intact--and also including branches which broke off a tree while the rest of the tree is still standing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the process, from start to finish, for milling a tree into boards&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; differentiating these concerns could cause this to be treated as a general catch-all question; in turn causing many future, more specific, questions to be marked as duplicates when the answers to this question may not specifically address the nuances of the more specific questions. I've observed this problem many times on SU and have been disappointed when a very good, very specific question was summarily closed because it fell under the umbrella of a generic catch-all question. (For example, &quot;How do I do X on Linux?&quot; is often closed as a duplicate of, &quot;How do I do X?&quot; even if all the existing answers are only relevant to Windows.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the question should &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; be split into the following questions, each of which should be written such that it can be answered definitively and objectively:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How do I determine whether milling a tree into lumber will be worth the time, cost, and effort?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is the process, from start to finish, for milling a tree into boards?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="49" LastEditorUserId="49" LastEditDate="2015-04-27T07:43:33.140" LastActivityDate="2015-04-27T07:43:33.140" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

If you're using a Kreg jig, you might want to invest in a Kreg Right-Angle clamp, which makes it much easier to secure the work pieces for screwing.  Even with the right-angle clamp, however, I did have some bending issues.  Now that I have big pipe clamps in my arsenal, if I were to make this workbench again, I would probably use the right angle clamp AND pipe clamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't measure each piece when making multiples of the same size.  Measure the first piece and then cut.  Use that cut piece to mark the same distance for each subsequent cut.

This is easy to do simply by providing an example demonstrating a practical situation in which keeping two or more of the same tool provides a measurable benefit (in most cases, time saved). The monetary cost and the space occupied are not necessarily factors when determining whether it could be useful to have multiples of a given tool, though they may be factors in determining whether or not it makes sense to apply this usefulness to your own situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;NOT useful in multiples&quot; question, as it turns out, is much more difficult to prove for any given tool, because one cannot just provide a single counterexample to the usefulness of a second copy of that tool. Instead, one must logically prove that it makes no sense for anyone to have multiples. This question has turned out to be more difficult to answer objectively than I had initially intended, and in hindsight I agree that it is an opinion question. I've tried limiting the scope through a couple of edits, but it now feels like I'm grasping at straws. I'm beginning to think the &quot;NOT useful in multiples&quot; question might not be salvageable, or would need to be reframed in the manner you've suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: I've now reframed the question per your suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="49" LastEditorUserId="49" LastEditDate="2015-05-30T14:45:43.607" LastActivityDate="2015-05-30T14:45:43.607" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

So requests for clarification often go unheard. This is never fun for anyone, but it's particularly harsh on a small and growing community still trying to establish their scope and standards for quality - for this reason, we &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; create default migration paths to beta sites, and strongly discourage even moderators from migrating to/from sites in their formative stages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[I]n most cases, it's more effective - and &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; more expedient - to skip migration entirely and just &lt;strong&gt;vote to close as off-topic while leaving a comment&lt;/strong&gt; directing the asker to a more appropriate site (or sites...).

Paul Sellers is probably the prime example: the only power tools I've seen him use are a band saw and a cordless screw driver (for jigs etc). I'm calling out &quot;professional&quot; specifically here as they have larger budgets and larger workspaces.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The craftsman/hobbyist hand tool woodworker. Here you likely have, for example, most people who live in cities. Hand tools require much less space for a workshop (a corner of a bedroom and a workmate can be enough), are usually far quieter to use, and are more accessible to those on a small budget. (Again, Paul Sellers' later videos address this group)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &quot;rural&quot; woodworker. Someone with a garage or shed large enough to have a dedicated workspace in which they can set up tools like jointers, planers, stationary table saws, and so on. They might not make a living from woodworking: instead it might be part of (say) running their farm or maintaining their house, or a hobby. There are quite a few of these on the 'tube, and they often include a lot of tool reviews/unboxings etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The primarily power-tool based - I think Steve Ramsey is the best example. Large workshop, rarely picks up a hand tool, very focused on the end product and less so on the experience and sensations of working the wood.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The mixed user. Here, think Rob Cosman and &quot;Stumpy Nubs&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The homeowner doing an occasional DIY job which actually (and primarily) needs woodworking skills and knowledge. Think about building a full-height wooden shoe rack into a closet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm coming at it from the tools direction (there are other, probably better, criteria), because I think that is likely to drive the type of questions you see (and the type of people available for answering them). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Someone who is a house framer, for example, would have a very different approach to joining two pieces of wood at a right angle than a pure hand tools person. Heavy power tool users might drive a lot of discussion around dado blades, kickback, lathe techniques, and so on. A craftsman/hobbyist might want help choosing their minimal toolset (a #4, #4 1/2, or #5 plane for example): advice which is not sponsor-driven can be hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this is before we consider artists who work in wood: sculpture/carving, marquetry, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8754" LastActivityDate="2020-06-09T12:58:50.580" Title="Which types of woodworking of woodworking are we focusing on?"

I may give a partial answer in a comment to make a specific point with the hope that the OP will provide the info and someone will provide a more complete answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some questions are too broad and a full answer is not possible.  I always ask for more information, especially photos and drawings (I am very visual). Without this additional input I do not think a full answer can be made, but if I have some thoughts I want to put them out there so that my concerns are included in answers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes I do not believe I am the best person to offer a complete answer, but I do have some relevant experience to pass on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The answers that appear on WSE tend to be pretty informed. I see the discussions that sometimes emerge in the comments as very valuable.  Very often there are many ways to approach a problem with none being more or less right than others.

I see them as public information and would invite anyone to take the ideas included and consolidate them into a viable answer. This is especially good for newer community participants looking to build reputation credit.  WSE is a very supportive community.

here refers both to &lt;a href=&quot;https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/users&quot;&gt;the membership of Woodworking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators&quot;&gt;diamonds next to their names&lt;/a&gt;, and to the automated systems otherwise known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/users/-1&quot;&gt;user #-1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;³ A &amp;quot;destroyed&amp;quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user&quot;&gt;Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁵ Includes close flags (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; close or reopen votes). Community can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Further reading:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time? We posted a similar report here last year: &lt;a href=&quot;https://woodworking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/405/2021-a-year-in-moderation&quot;&gt;2021: a year in moderation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackexchange.com/search?q=title%3A%222022%3A+a+year+in+moderation%22&quot;&gt;this report on other sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or peruse &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/386090/208518&quot;&gt;detailed information on the number of questions closed and reopened across all sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wishing everyone a happy 2023! ^_^&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="222" LastEditorUserId="222" LastEditDate="2023-01-26T20:07:12.783" LastActivityDate="2023-01-26T20:07:12.783" Title="2022: a year in moderation" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;moderation&gt;&lt;statistics&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />
