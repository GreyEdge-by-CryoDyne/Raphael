# ProjectTemplates Directory

## Introduction

This directory serves as a centralized repository for various templates and code snippets used in the Raphael project. It contains templates for file decompression, data processing scripts, and configuration files.

## Directory Structure

- `Decompression`: Contains templates for different file decompression methods, such as ZIP, 7Z, and TAR.
- `DataProcessing`: Includes templates for standard data processing tasks.
- `Configurations`: Stores configuration files and related templates.

## Usage Guidelines

Templates are designed to be copied and modified as needed for specific tasks within the project. For example, to add a new decompression method, copy the relevant template from `Decompression`, and modify it according to the new requirements.
